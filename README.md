# fail2web

fail2web is a [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org) GUI that communicates with a fail2ban instance via [fail2rest](https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2rest)

fail2ban allows you to administer the following

* **Failregex** - Delete and add new failregexes
* **Banned IPs** - Ban and Unban IP address
* **Per Jail Config** - Configure find time, max retry and usedns per jail, and view the filelist per jail
* **Alerting** - Notifications when an IP address is banned and unbanned with a user configurable time span
* **Regex Testing** - Testing ignore+fail regexes on your current logs to quickly build and debug regexes
* **Reporting** - Expose the time that an IP address was banned, and show trends via visualizations

## Requirements

fail2web communicates with fail2ban via a REST server called [fail2rest](https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2rest)
before fail2web can be used you will need an operational fail2rest instance.

fail2web has been reported to work on IE8 or newer, but is not actively tested on older platforms.

## Installing

A guide to install fail2web on Ubuntu can be found [here](http://siobud.com/blog/installing-fail2web)

If you find any errors open an PR against the markdown [here](https://github.com/Sean-Der/sioBuD.com/blob/master/lisp/blog/installing-fail2web.md)

### Docker

* To build simply run `docker build -t fail2web:sampletag .`
* Sample `docker-compose.yml` located in the root directory

Many thanks to <https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-fail2web>

### Production

To install the production build of fail2web download the newest release. A fully built release will then be in the
`web` directory. Now you just need to serve the index.html, you can find further instructions [here](https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2web#deploying-and-configuration)

### Development

* **Install build requirements**
  * nodejs and npm for browserify (not a runtime requirement) [Installing Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
* **Install libraries**
  * execute `npm install` in the root of the fail2web repository
* **Building**
  * When writing code run `npm run watch` this will rebuild web/bundle.js on every change
  * When deploying run `npm run build` this will build once and exit

## Deploying and Configuration

fail2web is best accessed via a HTTP server, you can find example HTTP server configs [here](https://github.com/Sean-Der/fail2web/tree/master/http-configs)

Fail2web has only one configuration option available via config.json in the root of the web folder.
This config option allows you to specify the path to your fail2rest handler. Currently the config.json uses /api/
which is what all the example HTTP configs are configured to do.

## Security

It is very important that you configured fail2rest correctly, a public facing fail2rest server could be very dangerous
(someone could add inclusive regexes, remove themselves from the banned IP lists etc..)

Out of the box fail2rest has no authentication, and I have no plans of rolling my own authentication.

### HTTP Basic Auth

The HTTP configs are both set to use HTTP basic auth, this and SSL should be the absolute minimum security
requirements. In both HTTP configs you will see a placeholder with the label of `YOUR_HTPASSWD_FILE`

To generate a HTTPASSWD file you can use the `htpasswd` util distributed with Apache HTTPD
and `htpasswd -c YOUR_HTPASSWD_FILE USERNAME` will create it.

### SSH Tunnel

I also recommend only serving fail2web/fail2rest on loopback only. You would access the server via a
SSH tunnel, you can find more info [Here](http://www.revsys.com/writings/quicktips/ssh-tunnel.html)

## Getting Help

Please make a GitHub issue, this will allow others in the future to find the issue in the future.

Most of the time I will not be able to respond to emails in a timely manner, however with GitHub issues I try
my best to keep the count 0.
